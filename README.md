# Repo-2
For repo 2 I ran the same code in three different ways.
To run the script on the terminal, I first wrote it in a text editor with a .py extension. Then, from the terminal, using cd I got to the folder where the script was saved, I typed python followed by the name of the document and pressed enter.
### First in the windows and linux terminals.

### Then in the python interpreter.
For running the code in the python intermpreter, I opened the terminal and typed python3, which opens the python interpreter. Then I wrote and ran the code there.

### And finally in Visual Studio Code.
I first created a new file in VS code, I also tryed opening an already existing file. In the first case I wrote the code on VS code and then ran it, in the second case I just ran it there.
